Python-Scripts
============

The goal of this repository is to provide helpful tips, tricks, and scripts to non-technical Product Managers and Growth Hackers like myself. Over my time as a PM at HubSpot, writing these scripts have been incredibly empowering in combatting incomplete data sets and gathering actionable intellignece used in product decisions.

1. averagesynctime.py - calculate the average sync time of the HS-SF connector
2. getlistsforworkflows.py - find all the lists in hubspot that feed automation for a particular portal, and write it to a file for a coworker.
3. proportals.py - identify a subsegment of HubSpot accounts. Deals with an endpoint that would occassionally throw a 400 for some accounts, and stored key value pairs in two distinct pairings, one for the key and one for the value.
4. csv-users.py - create a csv of useful data off of HubSpot's APIs. Used often for tracking or users and their API consumption, along with demographic data
5. google-places.py - script for reverse geocoding using Google APIs. The goal in this case was to take a list of domains and find the zipcode for each. Useful for growth hackers or territory assignment/analysis in an organization.
