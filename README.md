Python-Scripts
============

A couple helpful scripts I've used.

1. averagesynctime.py - calculate the average sync time of the HS-SF connector
2. getlistsforworkflows.py - find all the lists in hubspot that feed automation for a particular portal, and write it to a file for a coworker.
3. proportals.py - identify a subsegment of HubSpot accounts. Deals with an endpoint that would occassionally throw a 400 for some accounts, and stored key value pairs in two distinct pairings, one for the key and one for the value.
